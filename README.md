This folder (/home/605/agarwa/assign2) contains 2 subfolders Montecarlo and Trapezoidal.  
- MonteCarlo: This folder has programs that approximate value of pi using Montecarlo method of generating random co-ordinates. \
	      There are 2 c programs here, one which runs the code in a serial manner and the other that uses pthreads to \
	      calculate the same. The parallel code doesn't use any mutual exclusion. 
		      
- Trapezoidal: This folder has programs that approximate the area under the curve using the Trapezoidal rule. 3 of the programs \
	       are for parallel running and one is serial. Each of the parallel code uses a different kinds of methods \
	       like busy waiting, mutexes and semaphores. 
		       
- More about the programs, references used and analysis can be found in their respective folders \
	- MonteCarlo: /home/605/agarwa/assign2/MonteCarlo/ 
	- Trapezoidal: /home/605/agarwa/assign2/Trapezoidal/
